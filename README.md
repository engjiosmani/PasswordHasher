This project, developed by second-year Computer Engineering students at FIEK, is a complete user registration and authentication system. Built using Java, JavaFX, and PostgreSQL, it securely handles user credentials through PBKDF2 with HMAC SHA-256 password hashing and salt generation.

It includes an intuitive JavaFX GUI for login and registration, robust field validation, and real-time feedback through alerts and input control.
